# Hello-World
learning and advancing my coding skills 
My name is Joe. I just turned twenty five recently, I am looking to pursue a career with computers. Id like to know everything (BIG ambitions) I know its a little far fetched but we all have to start somewhere, I know some HTML and CSS kinda know begginer stuff into PYTHON and RUBY, having a hard time figuring out what language to select due to the fact that I really want to learn to be a great coder\programer.
